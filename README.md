# Project Details

This is a personal project intended to be displayed on a mobile phone.
The weather displayed is fixed to a specific location, and is intended to tell me what to dress my child in for Kindergarten today.

Open-Meteo API is used to retrieve weather info. Reshot icons for the wardrobe items are used.

React and Vite are used for the development, and the app is hosted on Firebase.

# Future Plans

- To create a setting function to alter the location
- To allow the users to customise the timings to display weather conditions for
- To allow the users to customise temperature and precipitation triggers for each wardrobe item.
